# News-Extraction
This is my first repository where I have tried news extraction using python. From the news webpage, I have extracted the headlines, keyword, image URL, source URL, author, summary of each news article on that web page.

# Objective
Extraction is the process of removing required data from a source. Here the source is a news website, Inshorts (https://www.inshorts.com/en/read). Ultimately the data extracted is in the form of string. After extracting the data, I have tried to parse it. Parsing is a method where one string of data gets converted into different forms of data. The source code extracts the headlines, keyword, image URL, source URL, author, summary of each news article on that web page.

# Technologies used
I have written the source code in python with the help of some libraries and built-in functions. The libraries I've used are 'requests',to requests the access of the data from the news webpage URL and 'bs4 (BeautifulSoup4)', to parse the data in the required form. The source code can run on any IDE that supports python 3 and has the above libraries installed.

# Code Output
The output of the code displays the headlines, keyword, image URL, source URL, author, summary each news article on that web page and the links to the different categories of news on that webpage (national, sports, education etc).

To learn web scrapping, I had an access to a course on "My Captain" platform (https://app.mycaptain.in/). I also learnt image and source URL extraction from "CodeWithHarry"'s YouTube video on web scrapping (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uufDGjTuq34).
