# The-Forty-Two-Times
### "Antithesis to the Enigma of Forty-Two"
42 is the answer to the ultimate question of the life, the universe and everything. The answer is known but the question is enigmatic. Our website aims to give the users the answers along with questions of the life, the universe and everything. We may not know the ultimate question soon, but we can always understand the other questions of life, the universe and everything and their answers by following the news. Our website aims to bring you just that. The website is still in development and we hope to better it as we go. Let us know how you find it!
